# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects and skills.  

## Technologies & Languages I Use

I mainly work with:

- **HTML** – for structuring web pages  
- **CSS** – for styling and making the website look nice  
- **JavaScript** – to add interactivity to web pages  
- **Node.js & Express** – for backend and server-side work  
- **MongoDB** – to store data for my projects  
- **React (optional)** – for building dynamic user interfaces  
- **Bootstrap** – for faster and responsive design  

I also have some experience in **Java** and **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)**.
