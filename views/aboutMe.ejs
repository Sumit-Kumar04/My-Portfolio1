        <p >
          Hello! I'm Sumit Kumar, a passionate BTech Computer Science student with a love for coding, design, and learning new technologies. My journey started with curiosity about how software works and has evolved into a deep commitment to mastering full-stack development.
        
        <br>
        
          Over the years, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and DSA. I enjoy building practical projects, exploring AI & Machine Learning, and sharing knowledge through videos and blogs.
        
        <br>
        
          Beyond coding, I believe in discipline, focus, and continual growth. I balance my time between college, personal projects, and fitness to stay sharp and productive.
        
        <br>
        
          This site is a reflection of my work and journey so far â€” thanks for visiting!
